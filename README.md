# spear-physics
simple physics engine for physics simulation or 3D game development

heavily inspired by [cyclone-physics](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics) by [idmillington](https://github.com/idmillington)


# Why named "spear"?
I don't know.  
That name just appeared in my head after an hour of struggling for naming.  
Since this engine was first for physics simulation, I can say "I wanted to make an accurate physics engine like you pierce a point with spear"
